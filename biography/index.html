					<h1>Here's how I got to now:</h1>
					From a young age, I was always interested in music. I was always tuning into the radio or making an instrument out of anything I could find around the house.
					My parents, tired of me banging on every available surface, gave me a variety of instruments. At age 9, I was given a plastic flute. At age 12, an old guitar.
					Once I got to 8th grade, I received one of my most beloved instruments: a half-broken drum kit from Goodwill. I searched all over for ways to improve my music
					playing and writing skills, hunting down old music sheets and practice guides, and asking older friends for music lessons. When I got to high school, I was 
					already certain I wanted to be a musician, so I looked even harder for more opportunities to improve my abilities. In my sophomore year, I found a flyer for a 
					music internship in a local music production studio. I was thrilled to find a chance to really learn about making music and get solid field experience with professionals. 
					I signed up, but I was turned down in favor of older and more experienced applicants. I was devastated. It felt like the one opportunity I had to become a true 
					musician and be able to enter the music industry. I hated to think that I would have to work in a 9 to 5 job for the rest of my life, and never be able to fulfil 
					my dream. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started to make songs and post them onto SoundCloud. My songs were inexperienced at first, but as I 
					gained more experience, and as I sought feedback from my peers, I slowly improved. Over time, as I experimented more and more with my music, I began to find my 
					own style of music and began to make a name for myself. After a while, several music companies began to approach me to sell my music. At first, they were few 
					and far between, and usually quite small, but as I improved and became more famous, bigger companies came for contracts. So that brings me to today. Right now 
					I'm a rapper in Seattle. I have a pit bull named Sparky. I'm just working on a new album, which I'll drop March 28th.
