					<h1>Here's how I got to now:</h1>
					It all started in September 2011. At that time, I was a high-school student.
					I'd always wanted to be a musician, so I was thrilled when I learned about an
					opportunity for a music club internship. I signed up, but didn't get in.<br><br>
					
					I was devastated. Not only would my music talent be squandered forever, I would
					be stuck for the rest of my life in a 9-to-5 office job. I couldn't have that.<br><br>
					
					And so, I started my wrapper name on SoundCloud. My channel was small at first, but
					over time I gained popularity. I was approached by several music companies, and they
					couldn't wait to sell my music.<br><br>
					
					So, that brings me here. Right now I'm a rapper in Seattle. I have a pit bull (his name
					is Sparky). I'm just working on a new album, which I'll probably release somewhere around
